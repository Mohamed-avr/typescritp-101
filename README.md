### What is typesciprt ? 
1. typescript is a storngly typed programming language that builds on javascript 
2. typescript developed by microsoft 
3. typescript is javascript with types 
4. typescript add features to javascript without changing it 


### Why we need typescript ?
* detect errors without running the code this called "static type checking" 
   - that means you can find the error while typing before to go to another thing 
* analyze the code as you type 
* save some unit test as the error show while writing 
* every JS file is valid TS file  
   - that means you can write javascript code isnide typescript file or code 
* will help you when you write react,vue,anguar,next.. apps 
* gives you the missing features in JS like "interfaces,generics,decorators" 

### How typescript works 
 - typescript compiler combile TS code into javaScript code "This Called Transpitaltion"
 - what about the new features in typescript that are not in js when the code of TS combiled to js code ? 
    - there is something called workaround is simulating the features of TS that are not exict in JS

  - variables 
  - arrays 
  - objects 
  - functions 
  - conditions
