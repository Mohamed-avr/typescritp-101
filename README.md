### What is typesciprt ? 
1. typescript is a storngly typed programming language that builds on javascript 
2. typescript developed by microsoft 
3. typescript is javascript with types 
4. typescript add features to javascript without changing it 


### Why we need typescript ?
* detect errors without running the code this called "static type checking" 
   - that means you can find the error while typing before to go to another thing 
* analyze the code as you type 
* save some unit test as the error show while writing 
* every JS file is valid TS file  
   - that means you can write javascript code isnide typescript file or code 
* will help you when you write react,vue,anguar,next.. apps 
* gives you the missing features in JS like "interfaces,generics,decorators" 

### How typescript works 
 - typescript compiler combile TS code into javaScript code "This Called Transpitaltion"
 - what about the new features in typescript that are not in js when the code of TS combiled to js code ? 
    - there is something called workaround is simulating the features of TS that are not exict in JS 

### What you need to know 
- javascript concepts (basic):
  - variables 
  - arrays 
  - objects 
  - functions 
  - conditions 

## install typescript & compile TS with js 02
what we will learn how to install typescript and how to combile TS with JS 
so first you need to check if you have Node.js by this code belew using terminal or Bash or powershell.

```
node -v 

ex:v19.8.1
```
if you don't have the node.js in your computer go to install it from this [website](https://nodejs.org/en)
then install TS in your computer following this code : 
```
npm i -g typescript
```
after this check if TS installed by cmd or bash 
```
tsc -v 
ex: Version 
```
now create a folder and open it in any editor to make the procces easier after this we will go to combile TS file with Js file 
first create a typescript file in isnide that folder like this one here : 

![index ts - typescript-101 - Visual Studio Code 6_6_2023 1_31_11 PM](https://github.com/Mohamed-avr/typescritp-101/assets/58856307/fbb60349-2e55-4766-8bdb-7a0893c1aaf1)


i created the file of TS and i name it index.ts you can give it the name you want also you see the folder name is typescript-101

now if let's try to code and  then we will combile it to js code
this below is typescript code we will combile it now 

``` 
const generateIDs= 1245;
console.log(Math.random() * generateIDs );
``` 
now in the same editor open the terminal and write this commend : 

``` 
tsc index.ts
```
now look to the folder you will see a new js file created has the same name with Ts file like this below :
![‚óè index ts - typescript-101 - Visual Studio Code 6_6_2023 2_51_30 PM](https://github.com/Mohamed-avr/typescritp-101/assets/58856307/ff8efe56-1209-42eb-9543-149e0b613bc9)

to combile a TS  code to JS code this means to create another JS file
